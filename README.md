# Dataparency D-ISP&trade; Examples

Dataparency Information Sharing Platform&trade; is an Entity-centric, Entity-bound, and Entity-controlled NoSQL database providing access control, security, and a 'schema agnostic' data model. 

It is highly scalable as data can be sharded by entity. Combined with FaaS like AWS Lambda, it can support thousands to millions of accesses per second. 
It is appropriate for use cases where privacy and security are an essential need.
Reference the whitepaper for further details.
